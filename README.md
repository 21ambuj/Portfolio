‚ú® About This Portfolio
This isn't just a standard portfolio; it's a creative project in itself. I wanted to build a memorable and engaging digital experience that reflects my passion for front-end development and modern web technologies.

The key features include:

Dynamic 3D Background: An animated background rendered with Three.js to create a sense of depth and interactivity.

Creative Cursors: A custom cursor that provides visual feedback when hovering over interactive elements.

Advanced Animations: Smooth, choreographed animations for section reveals, text, and UI elements, powered by Anime.js.

Glassmorphism Design: A modern, layered "glass" effect on UI cards and the header for a clean, sophisticated look.

Fully Responsive: A mobile-first design that ensures a seamless experience across all devices.

üõ†Ô∏è How It's Built
This portfolio was built from the ground up using a combination of modern web technologies:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Styling: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first workflow.

3D & Animations:

Three.js for the dynamic 3D background shapes.

Anime.js for orchestrating complex UI animations.

Fonts: Google Fonts (Space Grotesk & Montserrat).

Icons: Font Awesome.
